## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: Define what category  (or combination of categories) of simulation needed to solve this problem.)
I would use a combination of agent based and continuous based simulation. 

(remove: Why did you choose this simulation type?)
I would use agent based simulation beacuse people are the ones causing most of a city's problems such as pollution, crime, and trash. I would also use a continuous based simulation beacuse the sensors continue to track data and the city is continuously monitored with the robots. People continue to live, work, and damage the city. Inputs would include sensors taking in data, audio and video capture, person contolling the robots. Outputs include cleaning up after seeing litter, repairing something based on damages, and purifying air and planting trees based on air quality levels.

(remove: Roughly, how would you conduct the simulation to produce the results from your specification?)
I would conduct the simulation to produce the results from my specification by simulating a citie's crime, pollution, and trash levels. I would have people controlling the robots in the simulation using data from the robot and go to the trouble areas. Then they would use the robot's features to fix the problem based on what the sensors and robot data is telling them. If the levels decreased of pollution, trash, and crime it would support the hypothesis.
