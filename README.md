## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

It is important to solve the problem of crime, pollution, and trash because thousands of people live in the cities. They are working, living, and helping to cause these conditions. These problems can be seen and have increased during the Industrial Revolution.


In 2016 New York City has about 8.5 million people living there. Common sights in N.Y.C. are smoke plumes rising from rooftops and truck exhaust can be smelt. Air pollution can cuase serious health problems including asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease. "The city recently estimated that up to 2,700 premature deaths a year could be attributed to fine particulate matter and ozone in the airâ€”more than eight times the number of murders that took place in 2013."

Some proposed solutions and current solutions for trash, pollution, and crime in cities are promoting recycling, planting trees, cameras, and robots for resilient infrasruture to make self repairing cities.

## Requirements (Experimental Design)
Many cities are filled with pollution, trash, and crime. Hypothesis: Smart cities with this remote controlled robot can help reduce these problems of pollution, trash, and crime in cities. The requirements are to model a city then to have actual humans controlling the robots in the simulation to see if there is a reduction in crime, pollution, in trash levels in the simulated city. The robot and controller would have to have availability, maintainability, reliability, and security requirements. In the simulation we would have to see how the remote controlled robots handle in different environmental conditions.


## Smart City (My Problem) Model
Some types of data I would need to collect are air quality levels, crime stats, battery levels, visual and audio data. The control class has a cleanUp class, power class, surveillance class, foilage class, pollution class, and restore class. Foilage has 2 classes, produce and flowers.

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation
I would use a continuous based simulation to test my hypothesis of remote controlled robots to reduce crime, trash, and pollution. If the crime, trash, and pollution decreased the pollution the hypothesis is supported. If the crime, trash, and pollution increased or stayed the same the hypothesis would be null.
